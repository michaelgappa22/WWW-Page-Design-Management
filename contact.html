                        I was born in New York City and raised until I was a teenager. I graduated to Robinson High School and jumped straight into the workforce. I worked at several restuarants and eventually got a job at Greater Tampa REALTORS.

                        After several years of working, learning and discovering my true self, I fell in love with Technology and started at Hillsborough Community college. I'm currently attending USF to
                    attain my bachelors degree.

                         I like to travel between cities and small towns during my free time. I love music, tattoos, and I love video games! I plan on becoming
                    a full technical solution archtect with Microsoft Technologies! I also code as a hobby to gain more knowledge in development and apply it to my field of work.
